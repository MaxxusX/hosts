# Maxxus' hosts!!!!! (https://github.com/MaxxusX/hosts)



## DISCLAIMER: most of the lists here were *not* made by me, I only formatted them to be used in the hosts file



## TUTORIAL:
***(TLDR: copy all of the text in this file, and paste it into your "hosts" file. (can be found at "C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\"))***
Use this file to prevent your computer from connecting to selected
internet hosts.

I use 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1, as it is slightly faster. HOWEVER,
it may not be compatible with all systems.
if this is not compatible with your system, "simply" replace every
occurrence of "0.0.0.0" with "127.0.0.1" (get Notepad++, use Ctrl+F,
select the "replace" tab, put "0.0.0.0" in the "Find what:" box
and "127.0.0.1" in the "Replace with:" box, then click "Replace All".
THIS WILL CAUSE LAG DUE TO THE SIZE OF THIS FILE!!!!!!)

This file must be saved as a text file with no extension. (This means
that the file name should be exactly as below, without a ".txt" appended.)
I repeat, the file should be named "hosts" NOT "hosts.txt".

For Windows 8, 10, and 11, use "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
 	You may need to tell Windows Defender to ignore this path
 	see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2764944
You may have to use "Run as Administrator"
